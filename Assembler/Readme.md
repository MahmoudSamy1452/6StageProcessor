- Software needed to run assembler: GCC Compiler

## Steps to run Compiler:
1. Create a program in a text file (extension: ".txt").
2. Run Assembler.exe using cmd by tying ``Assembler.exe``.
Alternatively, Open Assembler.cpp on VS code and run.
3. Input filename and hit Enter.
4. If the program was compiled successfully, A "Success" message will be printed and Program.mem will be updated.
5. Otherwise, an error message will be printing indicating the line causing error and Program.mem will be emptied with a message saying "There is an Error".
